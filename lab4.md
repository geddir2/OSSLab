## 2 Why is it important to have a liscense  
The liscnse of a repository is a legal document which stipulates the redistributon and use allowances for eveyone. 
Some examples of these are a liscense mentioned in class that prohibits the software from being used in a negative 
or destructive ay towards society. Some are more open and can be used to prevent certain people from using the 
software

## 3 Why is it important that you SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?
The abscense of a liscense defaults to copyright laws. Meaning that all of the code belongs to the original creator
and if you edit or use that code you could potentially find youself on the wrong side of a lawsuit over copyright 
infringement. Brcuase of this it is best to not touch unliscensed code. 

## 4 Why the web beat Gopher
I 100% agree with this. The author states in the article that the liscense is structured in a way to prevent people 
who want to help better the software. Also on top of this there is such a rapid turnover in technology that help this. 
Without using all the resources you can to better your software itll lead to the downfall of your technology.

I chose to create the repository  [here](https://github.com/geddir2/OSSLab).

I gave it  an MIT license to allow whoever to reference the work.

1. 
i.  a communication app for fans
ii.  currently there is a rcos app for the red army but hasnt been started yet
iii. mostly just app development programs 
iv.  I would like the app to be a mix of reddit, gorup me, and a stat app. It would have the reddit function of having 
a discussion board and bple to have disussions with the other fans. The group me part would have the ability to message your
friends about the upcoming game and about otehr things. The stat part would have the temas stats, standings, and scheudle. 
On top of this I would think the app would have alerts for games. Also real time scores, and posisbly other features as well.
Finally while I think RPI would be a good start it could be a blanket app and be applicable to otehr teams in the future.

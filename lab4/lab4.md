## 2 Why is it important to have a liscense  
The liscnse of a repository is a legal document which stipulates the redistributon and use allowances for eveyone. 
Some examples of these are a liscense mentioned in class that prohibits the software from being used in a negative 
or destructive ay towards society. Some are more open and can be used to prevent certain people from using the 
software

## 3 Why is it important that you SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?
The abscense of a liscense defaults to copyright laws. Meaning that all of the code belongs to the original creator
and if you edit or use that code you could potentially find youself on the wrong side of a lawsuit over copyright 
infringement. Brcuase of this it is best to not touch unliscensed code. 

## 4 Why the web beat Gopher
I 100% agree with this. The author states in the article that the liscense is structured in a way to prevent people 
who want to help better the software. Also on top of this there is such a rapid turnover in technology that help this. 
Without using all the resources you can to better your software itll lead to the downfall of your technology. 

## 5 Justification for Linux using the GPLv2 license
Linux's copyleft switch to a GPL liscense allowed for it to be intergrated with GNU. The most important reason for them 
to switch the liscnese was the ability to monitize their creation. The original liscense they used prohibited the
monitization of the code. With the switch they were allowed to monititze the code and was benifical to them. 

## 6  Example Project. Pick a license as a group using license chooser on github.
a twitter bot that tweets memes based on the day of the year or day of the week. We chose an MIT Liscense

## 7 Read these licenses GPL, LGPL and Apache/BSD and discuss which one will be better, for a developer, for a company and for the common good
The Apache/BSD is best fit for companies. The GPL license makes any code derivied from a GPL code be realsed with a GPL 
liscense. This liscense allows for monitization. This could deter a business from altering a code base for profit as they
will have to make their source code public. Making it best for the developer. Using the LGPL do not have to relist their
modified software under the LGPL license, in fact it deosnt even need to be relisted. LGPL benefits developers.


## 8 Create a repository and choose a license
I chose to create the repository  [here](https://github.com/geddir2/OSSLab).
I gave it  an MIT license to allow whoever to reference the work. 

## 9 
I'm planning on working on a project from RCOS. I think not only would it be really cool to work on somthing for the RPI 
community. Also if I dont understand somthing or need to ask somthing having people areound me who even if they arent wokring 
on the project have a possibility to be knowledgeable on the subject matter if it pertains to something on the RPI cmapus.

It is important to choose a license due to the legal protections it give you. A license allows the decree of what can 
and cant be done with the code by the group of or sinular creator. There are multiple licenses that are possible to choose
from and each one has its own speciffic features.

The lack of a license signifies that copyright laws apply and thus anything forked or used from the code belongs to the 
original creator and thus could put you in copyright limbo and possibly a lawsuit. It's a safe bet to air on the side 
of caution with the lack of a license.

I dont have any preticular type of project in mind. However i feel the best would me a MIT license allowing people to use
and help with the code in anyway they want/can.

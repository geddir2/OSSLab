It is important to choose a license due to the legal protections it give you. A license allows the decree of what can 
and cant be done with the code by the group of or sinular creator. There are multiple licenses that are possible to choose
from and each one has its own speciffic features.

The lack of a license signifies that copyright laws apply and thus anything forked or used from the code belongs to the 
original creator and thus could put you in copyright limbo and possibly a lawsuit. It's a safe bet to air on the side 
of caution with the lack of a license.

I totally agree. By having the license the way they did it prohibited people who wanted to help Gopher. This along with other 
things mentioned in the article lead to the downfall of Gopher.

Originally linux used a license which did not allow a profit to me made for distrubuiting it for a monetary reward. Due 
to this GNU would not have been possible and decided to writch to GPL.

I dont have any preticular type of project in mind. However i feel the best would me a MIT license allowing people to use
and help with the code in anyway they want/can.

the best licnese for a company would be Apache/BSD. For best for buisness and also in part the greater good is GPL. It 
allows for the charge of money for the program. and it also allows for the use of code for the greater good but not being
distrubiuited. Thus this both is benificial to the greater good and also developers.

and i added a MIT license to be laissez faire about it

 I would like to work on a RCOS project. It would be used by students and staff at the school, and potentially people 
 who are not involved in RPI. Due to the fact that i want to have it be potentially useable by people outside of
 RPI I would use a MIT license in order to allow for as easy use as possible for any and everyone. LGPL is best for developers
 and no need to relist modified software and is very popular with developers for this reason.
